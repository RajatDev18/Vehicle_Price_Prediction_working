# Predict Vehicle Prices
## Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts vehicle prices based on various specifications such as make, model, year, engine details, and more. The goal is to analyze the data, identify key factors affecting vehicle prices, and develop an accurate predictive system.

## Objective

To create a system that can estimate the price of a vehicle using its features and specifications. The project involves data exploration, feature engineering, and predictive modeling.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information on multiple vehicles, including their specifications and prices.

## Description of Columns

name: Full name of the vehicle, including make, model, and trim.

description: Brief description of the vehicle with key features or selling points.

make: Manufacturer of the vehicle (e.g., Ford, Toyota, BMW).

model: Model name of the vehicle.

year: Year the vehicle was manufactured.

price: Vehicle price in USD.

engine: Details about the engine, including type and specifications.

cylinders: Number of cylinders in the engine.

fuel: Type of fuel (e.g., Gasoline, Diesel, Electric).

mileage: Mileage of the vehicle, typically in miles.

transmission: Type of transmission (e.g., Automatic, Manual).

trim: Trim level indicating different feature sets or packages.

body: Body style of the vehicle (e.g., SUV, Sedan, Pickup Truck).

doors: Number of doors on the vehicle.

exterior_color: Exterior color of the vehicle.

interior_color: Interior color of the vehicle.

drivetrain: Drivetrain type (e.g., All-wheel Drive, Front-wheel Drive).

## Tools and Technologies

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization

## Approach

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and inconsistent data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand relationships between features and price.

Feature Engineering: Select and transform important variables for prediction.

Model Building: Train regression models to predict vehicle prices.

Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics like R², MAE, and RMSE.

# Expected Outcome

A predictive model capable of estimating vehicle prices accurately, helping users and dealers make informed pricing decisions.
